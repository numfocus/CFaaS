<h1>Communicating Feedback as a Service (CFaaS) FAQ</h1>

<ol>
<li>What is Communicating Feedback as a Service (CFaaS)?

CFaaS connects people from within a community, project or group to improve communication using constructive and actionable feedback.
</li>
<li>How does it work?

(fill info)
</li>
<li>Is it anonymous?

Yes.
</li>
<li>Why was this created?

We created CFaaS at the Diversity & Inclusion in Scientific Computing (DISC) Unconference at PyData NYC 2017. During our group discussions about Retention and Support for community members of open source, anonymous feedback was suggested as a tool for empower individuals wishing to express sensitive feedback. By using a moderator to mitigate abuse and providing a structured format to ensure constructiveness, we believe CFaaS provides the means and will to effectively provide difficult feedback.
</li>
<li>What are the goals of this project?

Ideally, once someone sends feedback through CFaaS, the recipient can reflect (with the moderator, if they want to) on actions to resolve the situation that was mentioned.
</li>
<li>Why not just solve it in person?

Many people can be intimidated if they have to personally confront someone within their communities. For example, if the feedback is intended to people who are very important or very involved in the group, they might feel like they have no one to talk to. 
</li>
<li>Can I use this in my project?

Yes! (instructions)
</li>
<li>Why are there moderators?

The moderators act as an independent third party, and could help facilitate conversations or guide people on how to act on the feedback they received. They can also help with the follow up to the feedback.
</li>
<li>Who are the moderators?

Each project can choose to have a database of moderators, or to ask people to moderate discussions as necessary. The moderators are ideally people who are not involved in the occurrence, but each project or group can decide on their own criteria for selecting moderators.
</li>
<li>What types of feedback can I provide via CFaaS?

You can provide positive, negative or neutral feedback, by choosing the appropriate options on the questionnaire form. 
</li>
<li>Why are there only scripted bullet points, and not open text fields?

The choice to not allow open text fields is deliberate, and serves to keep the feedback objective and direct. However, if you feel you can’t express the situation or behaviour you want to talk about clearly, you can always request a moderated discussion with the person you intend to give feedback to. You can do this by selecting the appropriate check box in the “How would you like this resolved?” field.
</li>
<li>Will there be a follow up on my feedback?

It depends. The moderator will let you know if the person received your feedback, but they can choose not to respond. 
</li>
<li>How long till I hear back on my feedback?

Each project can decide if they want to set a time frame for the response.
</li>
<li>Why did I receive a CFaaS feedback?

Someone in your community or group felt the need to let you know something, and they wanted to make sure they did not offend you. This is a good thing! This means they want you in the community and think you have something to contribute. If you need help understanding the feedback please contact the moderator.
